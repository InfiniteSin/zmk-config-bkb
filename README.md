## Layout for [BastardKB](https://bastardkb.com) boards (and other 3x5+2)

The layout has coverage of near 100% of all the keys present on a standard 100% ANSI keyboard in the span of 6 layers and 4 thumb keys - the main exceptions being AltGr, RCtrl, RGui - without using Layer Taps or Mod Taps except on the NumPad Layer. This is done by using Tri Layers and thumb combos.

The base layer is [Aptmak](https://github.com/Apsu/aptmak), with V, Q, and Z, on combos as an adaptation to allow support on 30 key (23332) layouts like [Hummingbird](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird), [Batreeq](https://github.com/AlaaSaadAbdo/battoota#batreeq), [Rommana](https://github.com/AlaaSaadAbdo/Rommana), or [Luna](https://github.com/mindhatch/keyboards#%E3%83%AB%E3%83%8A-luna), with minimal modifications.
